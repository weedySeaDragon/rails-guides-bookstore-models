I created this to help people understand the examples in the Rails Guide.

I wanted people to have a chance to work with the "Bookstore models" (Author, Books, Customer, Order, Review, Supplier)
used in the Rails Guide "ActiveRecord Querying Interface".  Providing a simple Rails application with the models already defined means that people can simply clone this repo and quickly start to explore the models and example queries.
I wanted to save people -- especially novices who are coming up many learning curves at once -- the time and effort needed to figure out exactly how to define and scaffold the models used in the examples.

This provides a way to create data to work with (via seeding the database).

This is _not_ a complete or efficient Rails application.  This is a very bare-bones Rails application.
The focus is on presenting models just so the examples can be run, and a way to generate enough data to work with them.
The focus is _not_ on presenting this as a well-designed Rails website. Only very minimal layout (view) work was done.
(In a more realistic Rails application, more gems would be used and some models would be designed differently.)

You can use the rails console (rails c) to run the queries given in the examples in the guide.
You can also run the rails server and the see the data in web pages.


Is this helpful?  How could it be made _more_ helpful?
